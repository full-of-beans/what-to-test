# What to test?

---

### There are so many things to test
#### On top of that, there are so many ways to test

---

### So..
## What should we test?
## How should we test?
# 😟

---

### Some tips from experts

---

## Don't test the implementation details

#### Checkout this [blog](https://blog.kentcdodds.com/testing-implementation-details-ccb8d269586) for a couple of examples...

---

### In nutshell

#### - The tests can break when you refactor application code.

#### - The tests may not fail when you break application code.

---

### But, what is really meant by implementation details⁉️

---

### Implementation details are things which users of your code will not typically use, see, or even know about.

---

## Who are the users?
- End-users and
- Developers

---

### Great! 

#### So what parts of our code do each of these users use, see, and know about?

---

#### The end user will see/interact with what we render in the render method. 

#### The developer will see/interact with the props they pass to the component. 

---

### So, our test should typically only see/interact with the 

#### - props that are passed, and the 

#### - rendered output

---

#### The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you. 

---

### How to know what to test⁉️
#### (how to avoid testing the implementation details)

---

### The Process 
#### (one of many)

---

#### 1. What part of your untested codebase would be really bad if it broke? 

#### (The checkout process)

---

#### 2. Try to narrow it down to a unit or a few units of code 

#### (When clicking the “checkout” button a request with the cart items is sent to /checkout)

---

#### 3. Look at that code and consider who the “users” are 

#### (The developer rendering the checkout form, the end user clicking on the button)

---

#### 4. Write down a list of instructions for that user to manually test that code to make sure it’s not broken. 

#### (render the form with some fake data in the cart, click the checkout button, ensure the mocked /checkout API was called with the right data, respond with a fake successful response, make sure the success message is displayed).

---

#### 5. Turn that list of instructions into an automated test.

---

### Useful Tip

#### 100% code coverage is far from equal to 100% feature coverage.
#### The value is in the features, not the code 🤑
